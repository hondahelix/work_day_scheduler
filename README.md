# work_day_scheduler

## Description 

As people enter into their respective career fields, a plethora of these individuals find themselves feeling overwhelmed due to their busy schedules. This project sought to assist these individuals with a minimalistic interface that dynamically color codes and displays what needs to be achieved in a given hour. This functionality is achieved by utilizing the Moments.js API. These tasks can then be stored not to be lost even if the page is reloaded.

This project further helped me grow as a developer and was my first practice with Jquery and connecting to third party APIs. Working with APIs has exposed me and enabled me to access a vast range of data to improve my further applications. 

Though this is a simple application that should not have taken much time, I became stuck because I tried dynamically coding everything in Javascript and did not hard code any HTML rows. However, this proved to be beyond my current scope of expertise as I could not grab the necessary input from the user in the Textarea. This old area of code is highlighted in a screenshot below. I have decided to highlight this because it shows my thinking and growing and how I was willing to adapt to achieve the end goal.

## Installation

The installation for this project is to go my github repositories then navigate to Code_Refractor or click this link [Work Day Scheduler](https://github.com/hondahelix/work_day_scheduler) then click on the green code button in the top right. Then you can copy the code via ssh or by downloading a zip file.


## Usage 

This project's usage is to provide the user with a simple planner that updates as time passes and allows the user to focus on their schedule by filtering and giving the user a minimalist interface. The center of this application is a text area where plans can be imputed. If it is gray, it signalizes past events; red is the current hour, and green is the upcoming time. The blue area is buttons that can save the imputed reminders to local storage.
